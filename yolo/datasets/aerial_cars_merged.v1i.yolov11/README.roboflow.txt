The dataset includes 1367 images.
Cars-IThh-Mtq7-cars-9fvp are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.2 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
