The dataset includes 1424 images.
Cars are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -22 and +22 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
